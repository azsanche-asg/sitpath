# sitpath-eval

This repository hosts the evaluation suite for the CVPR paper **"SitPath"**. The package bundles the test harness and helper utilities that researchers can extend when validating SitPath results or adapting the evaluation to new datasets.

## Getting started

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```

The command above installs the package in editable mode and runs the smoke tests to ensure `sitpath_eval` imports correctly.
